        <h2>
          Work and holiday â€“ two words <br /> that used to be contradictory
        </h2>
        <p>
          Work used to be something that limited you from doing the things you
          wanted (travel, experience, socialise), rather than something that
          enabled you to do those things. Working in a different environment, a
          foreign culture, among inspiring people can be a tremendous creativity
          and productivity booster. We all have spaces where we feel most alive
          - whether it's a certain city, a farm or an island. All necessities
          are available on demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          We curate the most attractive long-stay deals for you with hotels
          around the world.
